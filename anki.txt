All HttpClient methods return?  an RxJS Observable of something
HTTP is what kind of protocol?  a request/response protocol - you make a request, it returns a SINGLE response
How is an Observable from HttpClient different from other Observables?  An Observable from HttpClient emits a single value and then completes, never to emit again whereas generally Observables can return multiple values over time.
What does HttpClient.get return?  the BODY of the response as an uptyped JSON object
How can you add a type to HttpClient.get's result object? By applying the optional type specifier <Book[]>
