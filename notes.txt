blurb




 *  still not so sure how to deal with genres and topics. would love coding system. is reference a part of nonfiction? or its own genre? what about verse and drama? do you tuck Homer in with verse, fiction, or history? our shelves have always been by topic, not by genre.
 ** how to deal with prehistoric Americas - prehistory? medieval?
 *** can you number the wishlist? what about different users and different wishlists? nope - just me.
 **** this is read instance, because you can read a book more than once. it is not a book instance. because we should never own more than one of a book.*****
 ***** but what if we do own more than one of a book?
