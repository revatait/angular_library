This is another library app, in my year-long attempt to create my own personal (non-social)(but otherwise better)(and definitely prettier) version of Goodreads. (With just so much more care for UX.) The goal is to learn Angular a bit deeper as I go.

See notes.txt for explanation of categories that doesn't belie the hours of research I've put into Library of Congress vs Dewey vs all the others I could find. See anki.txt for Angular vocabulary and concepts I want to understand and memorize.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
